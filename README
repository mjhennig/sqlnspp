NAME
    sqlnspp - SQL pretty printer

SYNOPSIS
        sqlnspp [-h] [-m] (file..)
        sqlnspp --help

DESCRIPTION
    The sqlnspp(1) tool is a very minimal SQL (not so) pretty printer with a
    commandline interface only. It will attempt to open and read each file
    specified when invoked (or from the standard input) and print a readable
    version of it's findings.

  Options
    Below please find a list of options recognized by sqlnspp(1):

    -h, --help, -?
        Print a short usage hint and exit gracefully

    -m, --mysql
        Try to use Mysql::PrettyPrinter instead of SQL::Beautify

  Examples
    Below please find a few examples of invocations of sqlnspp(1) and their
    resulting output:

        user@host:~$ echo "select * from information_schema.TABLES;" | sqlnspp
        select
            *
        from
            information_schema.TABLES;

        user@host:~$ sqlnspp <<<"create view test_view as select 1;"
        create view test_view as
        select
            1;
